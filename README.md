## Project Setup

### Backend Setup

#### Database Setup
1. Install _MySQL_ if not done so on https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
2. Open up the _MySQL_ command line and run `CREATE DATABASE medipal;` to create the database
3. Schema will be autogenerated once the server runs

#### Server setup
1. Change into backend directory by running `cd medipal-backend`
2. Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies by running `python -m venv be_venv`
3. Activate virtual environment by running `be_venv/scripts/activate` _(OS-dependent command)_
4. Install required dependencies by running `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. For local setup, enable CORS for localhost by modifying app.py:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask
   from flask_cors import CORS

   app = Flask(name)
   app.config.from_object(ApplicationConfig)
   CORS(
        app,
        resources={r"/api/*": {"origins": "http://localhost:3000"}},
        supports_credentials=True,
   )
   ```
6. For _MacOS_ users, change the port to run on 8000 due to conflicting ports and change accordingly in the frontend `.env`
7. Add the `.env` file to load the environmental variables
8. Start up the backend server by running `python app.py`

### Frontend Setup

1. Change into frontend directory by running `cd fe`
2. Install the required packages for initial start by running `npm install`
3. Start up the frontend server by running `npm start`
